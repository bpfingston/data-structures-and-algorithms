# Challenge Summary  

- Write a function called left join  
- Arguments: two hash maps  
  - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.  
  - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.  
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
