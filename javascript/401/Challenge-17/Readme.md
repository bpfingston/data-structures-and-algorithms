# Tree-Max
    Organize the tree using breadth first;


## Challenge

Code Challenge / Extending an Implementation
Write a function called breadth first. Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency

Breadth-first Traversal - Linear Complexity O(n)

## API
Write a function called breadth first
    Arguments: tree
    Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
