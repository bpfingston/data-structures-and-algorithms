# Graphs  

Implenting a graph by creating a class with methods, and ability to pass the following tests:  

1. Return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
2. Return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited, even if there is 1.
3. Return an error if there is no valid node.


## Challenge  

Write the following method for the Graph class:

breadth first

- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency  

BreadthFirst

Time: O(|V|+|E|)  
Space: O(n)  

V = vertices  
E = edges
