# Stacks and Queues
Made a funtion that validates whether the brackets within the string are balanced.

## Challenge
Code Challenge / Algorithm
    Write a function called validate brackets

    There are 3 types of brackets:

        Round Brackets : `()`
        Square Brackets : `[]`
        Curly Brackets : `{}`

## Approach & Efficiency
validate brackets -  linear complexity O(1).

## API
Write a function called validate brackets
    Arguments: string
    Return: boolean
        representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced
