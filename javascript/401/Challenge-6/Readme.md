# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Created Linked Lists and node classes. Added functions to Append, Insert Before, and Insert After.

## Challenge
    1.  Extending an Implementation

## Approach & Efficiency
Linear Complexity O(n) for the append function.  
Linear Complexity O(n) for the insertBefore funciton.  
Linear Complexity O(n) for the insertAfter function.  

## API
append
    arguments: new value
    adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list

insert before
    arguments: value, new value
    adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

insert after
    arguments: value, new value
    adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
