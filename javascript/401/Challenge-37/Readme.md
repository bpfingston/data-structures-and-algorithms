# Graphs  

Implenting a graph by creating a class with methods, and ability to pass the following tests:  

1. Returns True and price, if trip is possible.
2. Returns False and price, if trip is not possible.
3. Returns False and price, if trip has only 1 city.

## Challenge  

- Write a function called business trip
- Arguments: graph, array of city names
- Return: cost or null

## Approach & Efficiency  

Business

Time: O(|V|+|E|)  
Space: O(n)  

V = vertices  
E = edges
