    Find the max value within the tree.


## Challenge

Code Challenge / Extending an Implementation
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency

findMax - constant O(1)
transverse - linear O(n)

## API
Write the following method for the Binary Tree class

    find maximum value
        Arguments: none
        Returns: number
